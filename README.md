# AudiometryMultiClassClassification

C# ML.NET program to predict hearing loss type (conductive, sensorinerual, and mixed).

---

## Multi-Class Classification Metrics:

1. Micro Accuracy
2. Macro Accuracy
3. Log-Loss
4. Log-Loss Reduction

These four metrics are represented on a scale of 0.00 to 1.00. For a high-performing model, the log-loss should be close to 0.00. Macro-accuracy, micro-accuracy, and log-loss reduction should be close to 1.00.<sup>[1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/resources/metrics)</sup>

### Current Mutli-Class Metrics

Here are the latest mutli-class metrics for the AudiometryMultiClassClassification program:
```
   Macro Accuracy     = 1
   Micro Accuracy     = 1
   Log-Loss           = 0.0057
   Log-Loss Reduction = 0.9918
```
